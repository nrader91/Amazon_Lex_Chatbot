# RoboAdvisor for Retirement Plans

In this challenge I have been hired as a digital transformation consultant by a prominent retirement plan provider in the US.  

The goal is to increase their client portfolio through engaging customers.  I have decided to create an interactive robo advisor that will communicate with current/potential new customers and provide investment portfolio recomendations for retirement.  

I will accomplish the follwing 3 main tasks:
1) Initial Robo Advisor Configuration through AWS - Amazon Lex.
2) Build and test the Robo Advisor.
3) Enhance the Robo Advisor with Amazon Lambda Function.  

##  Conclusion

All chat bot settings are stored within the AWS Management Console.  

When creating a chatbot for your company there are many ways to customize the product in a way that will be useful to customers.

Here is a list of functionalites that I've discovered to be critical in creating a high level chat bot.

1) 7-10 Utterances
2) 3-4 Recommended/Custom Slots
3) 4-8 Custom cards with icons
4) Amazon Lambda Function
