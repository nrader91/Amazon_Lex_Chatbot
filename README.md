#RoboAdvisor for Retirement Plans

In this challenge I have been hired as a digital transformation consultant by a prominent retirement plan provider in the US.  

The goal is to increase their client portfolio through engaging customers.  I have decided to create an interactive robo advisor that will communicate with current/potential new customers and provide investment portfolio recomendations for retirement.  

I will accomplish the follwing 3 main tasks:
1) Initial Robo Advisor Configuration through AWS - Amazon Lex.
2) Build and test the Robo Advisor.
3) Enhance the Robo Advisor with Amazon Lambda Function.
